# write a program that takes a positive floating point number as input and 
# outputs an approximation of its square

# python squareroot.py
# please enter a postive number 14.5
# The square root of 14.5 is approx 3.8

integer = float(input("positive number to be square rooted"))
# postive number my program will request 

y = def f(X) :
    return X * X
    (f(2))
# the value of 'y' is the squareroot of 'x'

print('The square root of' positive number 'is approximately' y)
