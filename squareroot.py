# Carol Treacy
# write a program that takes a positive floating point number as input and 
# outputs an approximation of its square

# python squareroot.py
# please enter a postive number 14.5
# The square root of 14.5 is approx 3.8

import math 

number = int(input("positive number to be square rooted :" ))
# postive number my program will request 
sqrt = number ** 0.5 # this will get the square root
print("The Square root is approximately:", sqrt )

# I have only worked out how to get the square root 14
